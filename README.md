hello world, starting with github

Hi together,

my name is Mario and this will be my privat Github account for my privat homepage I am going to launch.
I am planning to do this website in scala or ruby on rails, I have not finally decided on this matter yet.
Maybe I am going to start with both of them and try to figure out if one of the suits my programming style more then the other.
